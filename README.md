Creator: Lasata Tuladhar (lt9vx)

This repository contains all of the necessary materials (the original data, the master script, additional sources and information, a hook document, and a rubric) to complete this case study project. Below is a brief description of each folder and file.

## DATA
The DATA folder can be found here: [Data](/DATA). It contains the two original datasets from the CDC used in this case study. These should be downloaded raw, as they will be cleaned and preprocessed in the master script.

## SCRIPTS
The SCRIPTS folder can be found here: [Scripts](/SCRIPTS). It contains the final master script, which has all of the code to produce the results of the project. The links for the coding resources are within the master script itself, at the very bottom.

## SOURCES
The SOURCES folder can be found here: [Sources](/SOURCES). It contains two articles from the CDC that provide background on the topic of COVID-19, which is further discussed in the hook document. These sources will also be cited below in the proper IEEE format.

## MISCELLANEOUS

The hook document can be found here: [Hook Document](/Hook_Document.pdf). It contains the context and motivation behind the case study, as well as a high-level description of the deliverables.
